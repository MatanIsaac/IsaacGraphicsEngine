## <div align="center">Project Overview</div>

Isaac's Object Loader is a fun little evolving project to create a graphical interface for loading and visualizing 3D objects in a scene. 
This application aims to provide basic interaction with 3D models, developed gradually during free time between semesters. 
Using C++ and OpenGL along with GLM, GLFW, and ImGui, this project allows exploration and experimentation with 3D graphics fundamentals.
### <div align="center">Features</div>

    3D Object Loading: Load various 3D models into the scene.
    Camera Controls: Move the camera around the scene to view objects from different angles.
    UI with ImGui: Use ImGui for an intuitive interface, allowing you to change textures, materials, and view object details.
    Basic Texture & Material Support: Adjust textures and materials of objects for a customized look.

### <div align="center">Libraries Used</div>

The project includes all necessary libraries, so there's no need to download them yourself.

included in the repo:
